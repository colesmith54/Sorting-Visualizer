# Sorting-Visualizer

## Overview
This is a lightweight, dynamic web application designed to help users understand the functioning of various sorting algorithms. By providing a real-time visualization of the sorting process, the application makes it easier to comprehend how different algorithms work and compare their efficiencies.

## Features
- **Visualization of Sorting Algorithms**: The application supports Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Cocktail, MinMax, Heap, Merge, Quick, Bogo, and Timsort. The sorting process is visualized in real-time, accompanied with matching audio, allowing users to observe how each algorithm operates.

- **Array Options**: Users can select the type of array to be sorted. Options include random arrays with or without duplicates, almost sorted arrays, reverse arrays, and the ability to input a custom array.

- **Algorithm Information**: For each sorting algorithm, the application displays information about its time complexities (best, average, and worst-case) and its space complexity. This information aids users in understanding the efficiency of different algorithms.

- **Code Implementation**: The application offers the standard and optimized code implementations of each sorting algorithm in JS. Users can easily view and copy these codes.

- **Dark Mode**: The application supports a dark mode feature to provide a visually comfortable and strain-free experience, especially in low-light conditions.

- **Adjustable Sorting Speed**: Users can customize the sorting speed as per their understanding and learning pace. This feature ensures a flexible and personalized learning experience.

- **Adjustable Array Size**: The application allows users to adjust the size of the array to be sorted. This flexibility helps in simulating various scenarios and observing the performance of sorting algorithms on different data sizes.

- **Step-by-Step Option**: A 'Pause' and 'Next' feature is available for users who want to go through the sorting process step-by-step. This is especially beneficial for beginners who are trying to understand the intricacies of each sorting step.

## Using the Application
To use the application, follow these steps:
1. Visit the [website](https://sort-algo-54.netlify.app).
2. Enable dark mode if desired.
3. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
4. Choose an array type or input a custom array. Adjust the array size if necessary.
5. Customize the sorting speed as needed.
6. Start the sorting process and observe the algorithm in action. Use the 'Pause' and 'Next' buttons for a step-by-step walkthrough.
7. View the sorted array output and the performance characteristics of the algorithm.
8. Access the standard or optimized code implementation of the selected sorting algorithm.
